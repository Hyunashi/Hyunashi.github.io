                <h1> Short Reflection </h1>

                <p> Overall, I am very happy with the design, aesthetics, interactivity and production of this website. I intended for the website to be clean and simplistic, with the theme
                    of being aesthetically pleasing and easy to view. Using a dark theme with a light seagreen accented around is enjoyable to look at and a ncie colour combination. The dark 
                    theme is easy on the eyes and is easier on the computer to view. In summary, producing this website has been an enjoyable experience for me and viewing my own final 
                    product is very rewarding. </p>

                <h1> Technical </h1>
                
                <h2> Structure </h2>

                <p> The structure of the page follows a basic layout of a website. The first section is a header containing a menu bar at the top of the website with the 4 buttons to navigate to the other pages.
                    Using a list of words linked to each page, removing the text styling and adding hover animations for interactivity. <br> <br> Below the menu bar is a 
                    title for the page seperated from its content with a horizontal line to specify which page the user is on. <br> <br> The next section of the page is 
                    where the content is, containing text images, links, and hover animations for interactivity. The content is laid out specifically to ensure that the 
                    page is not cluttered with text and is balanced with images and interactivity. This is to ensure the webpage is interesting and engaging to use.<br> <br>
                    Below the content is the last section of the page, the footer. The footer includes specific information about the webpage itself, such as the author 
                    of the page, date the page was last updated, and the what the website was produced for. </p>

                <h1> Aesthetics </h1>   

                <h2> Page Colour Palette </h2>

                <p> The page colour palette used was a dark grey and black, with light seagreen accents. The dark styling of the website is to ensure the website is easy 
                    on the eyes of the user, instead of using the strong white colours that is commonly used in websites. Another reason I used dark styling is because everyone 
                    changes websites to dark mode when given the option, so I decided to just create the website in a "Dark Mode" by default. This also reduces the amount of energy
                    used to display the page since the pixels of the display wont require to light up as much diplaying black or dark grey compared to white. Moreover, black, 
                    dark grey and light sea green go well together as colour combinations as shown in the specific colour palette. </p>

                <img src="colour_palette.png" alt="colour_palette" class="colpal">

                <h2> Animations </h2>
                
                <p> Hover animations are used to engage the audience and keep the website interesting to navigate. This also adds to the visual aesthetic of the website since 
                    I was able to add more light seagreen accents to parts of the webpage. All animations used in the website are hover animations, mostly for the menubar 
                    buttons and the hover overlays for the text on the images. Using the transition attribute to add a fading animation to transition to the hover settings, 
                    when the mouse hovers over the select element, it will animate and change to the hover settings from css. This was mainly used in the past page where there 
                    were 4 images that when the cursor hovers over the image, a text overlay appears and captions the image, one image behaves differently as the text overlay tells 
                    the user to click on the image which navigates to an external link to watch a video.  </p>

                <h2> Text visuals </h2>

                <p> The text on each webpage is spread and laid out to ensure that there is not an overwhelming amount of text for the user. The font colour used is white because it 
                    will contrast the most to the dark theme of the website. The white colouring makes the text easier to read on the dark grey background, rather than having a white 
                    background with black text, the white text is easier to read as explained in the "Page Colour Palette" section, the overall darker page theme is easier on user's eyes 
                    to look. The font family chosen is "Sans Serif" this is because it is the simplest and easiest font to read as it has no unneccessary decorations and each letter is 
                    easily distinguishable. Using CSS to set the text settings to each of the HTML text tags (&lt;p&gt;, &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;). These design choices make reading text 
                    from the webpage easy and effortless for the most proficient user experience. </p>

                <h2> Structure </h2>
                
                <p> The overall theme of the structure of the webpages was a simple, minimalistic and clean aesthetic. Better website are consice, simple and easy to look at. My website 
                    has an adequate amount text to images to not convolute the pages with too much text. Having images is effective as it gives a quick and easy visual representation of 
                    information, having a quick and effortless way to convey my information will greatly benefit the user experience of my website. Furthermore, I included a more blocky 
                    and structured aesthetic to my webpages, this provides consistency to my webpages and improves the visual appeal. </p>

                <h1> Accessibility </h1>

                <h2> Content Sizing </h2> 

                <p> The headings and subheadings are made clear as they are large in size compared to the paragraph text, this is both for the cleanliness and organisation of the website 
                    into consice sections that are obvious to the user. Main paragraphs of text are at an average size for a website and if the text is too small, the webpage can be zoomed 
                    into without obscuring any content from being shown. Images are made to fit the same margins as the content, making them large and easy to see. Centred images also make 
                    the webpage aesthetically pleasing as people generally look at websites quickly in a Z motion with their eyes, having the images in the centre allows for a effortless quick 
                    scan of the webpage for the user. The top menu bar and footer also stretch along the bottom of the webpage as these will be the most noticeable to the viewer from using the 
                    Z rule. </p>

                <img src="Z_website_scan.png" alt="Zweb" class="diagram">

                <h2> Text Visibility </h2>

                <p> If the text written on the webpage is too small for the viewer, using the zoom tool in the web browser is proficient in increasing the size of the text to improve readability. 
                    The text's margins decrease in size to ensure all the text is still displayed on screen comparitively to if the webpage decreased in size and the text would be lost off screen. 
                    This was done by setting the left and right margins to "auto" of the class "content" in CSS, this allows the margins to dynamically change depending on the webpage size. Setting 
                    a max width to the text prevents the text from stretching too far out when the webpage is displayed on a larger sized screen without restricting the width to a specific size. Moreover, 
                    images that cannot be viewed use the "alt" to add a description of the photo if the photo is disabled or cannot load and if the cursor hovers over the image, a text overlay description 
                    of the image is shown. </p>

                <h2> Contrast Visibility </h2>

                <p> Using a dark theme and dark grey background allowed for the content of the pages to have high contrast, namely the white text and the images. However, the image of the Canva 
                    logo needed to have a black background as it was blending too much with the dark grey background. Changing the background of the Canva logo to black brought more contrast a resulted 
                    in the image being easier to see and distinguish. The images on the past page have many colours and already contrast with the previous choice of a dark grey background, this saves
                    time in the process of making the website whilst also improving the visibility of the images and giving a more aesthetically pleasing look. Using the 
                    <a href="https://www.toptal.com/designers/colorfilter" target="_blank" class="link">Toptal</a> colour blind web page filter to check the visibility of the content whilst using the different colour blind 
                    filters this test was a success as all the content on the pages was easily viewable and the contrast between the colours allowed the text to be easily read. </p>

                <h2> Screen Size Changes </h2>

                <p> When viewing the page on a smaller screen such as a mobile phone or zooming in to the webpage, the layout of the page changes. Mainly on the first page, its demonstrated how the image is beside the text, 
                    however when zooming into this page, the image and text get closer. Instead of allowing the image to overlap with the text deeming the text to be unreadable, I used the @media rule 
                    to change how the layout of the page looks to fit the certain screen size. When zooming into the page, the text will be place underneath the image, this is for anyone viewing on a 
                    smaller screen size, or if the text is too small to read the user can zoom into the page without obscuring the text. Moreover, the other pages can be zoomed into without obscuring any 
                    content. </p>
