                <p> In my future years after my university degree, I plan to work at a primarily software based company. <br> <br> <span class="canva">Canva</span> would be an ideal company for me to work
                at after my university degree has been completed. This is because I've seen that Canva treats employees very well and the values Canva holds match with my own, and I have a relative that already has a full 
                time job working at Canva. Canva is a website that can be used to design and produce digital media such as logos, posters and presentations. <br> <br> From my 
                experiences in working on many types of projects, I would be interested in this because I enjoy multimedia production and digital deisgn, whilst also enjoying programming and 
                software development.</p>
