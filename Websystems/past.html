                <p> I have a lot of experience in the past working with computers, technology and software to develop and produce both academic projects, and personal projects.
                <br> <br> In my highschool years I took multimedia as a subject, this was a very memorable experience as it was my favourite subject and the subject I had 
                the most fun. </p>

                <p> I also created a cinematic video for my mechatronics project during my mechatronics subject last year. Additionally to designing, wiring and coding 
                    the project on my own. <br> <br> Mechatronics was enjoyable however, the physical aspect of embedded systems, the mechanical calculations required and 
                    the circuitry was not enjoyable for me. However, I did find the programming quite interesting and fun, in which I decided to pursue the most specialised 
                    area. </p>
